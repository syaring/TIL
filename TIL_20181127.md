### Dockerfile

(도커파일 분석중...)

- `EXPOSE <port>`: informs Docker that the container listens on, does not actually publish the port, do `docker run -p` to publish and map the port(s)
  - `EXPOSE <port>`: for the container
  - `docker run -p <port>`: for access the container from outsiders
- `docker build --no-cache`: Do not using cache when building the image
- if `WORKDIR /dirA`, the destinataion dir of  `COPY`, `ADD` is relative to working directory `/dirA`
  - ex) `COPY test.txt /data` means copy the test.txt file to `dirA/data`



### Linux Command

- `find .. -type d`: find the file type d(=directory)
- `find ... -exec command {} \;`
  - do command about the result of `find` until encounter `;`
  - `{}` is replaced by the current file name that `find`'s result
- `chown -R`: operate on files and directories recursively
- `mkdir /{A, B, ..}/{a, b, c ..}`: 각각의 디렉토리를 모두 생성
